## Chapter I

### **CI/CD** basics

**CI/CD** is a set of principles and practices that enable more frequent and secure deployment of software changes.

Reasons for using **CI/CD**:
- Team development
- Long software life cycle
- Shortened release cycle
- Difficulties in deployment and testing of large systems
- Human factor

**CI/CD** pipeline is a sequence of actions (scripts) for a particular version of the code in the repository,
which is started automatically when changes are made.

### **CI** basics

**CI** (Continuous Integration) refers to the integration of individual pieces of application code with each other.
**CI** normally performs two tasks as described below.

- BUILD
    - Checking if the code is being built at all
    - Prepare the artifacts for the next stages
- TEST
    - Codestyle tests
    - Unit Tests
    - Integration tests
    - Other tests you have
    - Test reports

### **CD** basics

**CD** (Continuous Delivery) is a continuous integration extension, as it automatically deploys all code changes to the test and/or production environment after the build stage.
**CD** can perform the following tasks.

- PUBLISH (If using a deployment docker)
    - Build container images
    - Push the images to where they will be taken from for deployment
- UPDATE CONFIGS
    - Update configuration on the machines
- DEPLOY STAGING
    - Deployment of test environment for manual tests, QA, and other non-automated checks
    - Can be run manually or automatically if CI stages are passed successfully
- DEPLOY PRODUCTION
    - Deploying a new version of the system on 'production'
    - This stage better be run manually rather than automatically
    - If you want, you can set it up for a specific branch of the repository only (master, release, etc.)

`-` There you go. If you have any questions, run what I said slowly through your head. I'll be right back.


## Chapter II

### Part 1. Setting up the **gitlab-runner**

##### Start *Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS* virtual machine
*Be prepared to save a dump of the virtual machine image at the end of the project*

##### Download and install **gitlab-runner** on the virtual machine

##### Run **gitlab-runner** and register it for use in the current project (*DO6_CICD*)
- You will need a URL and a token for runner registration, that can be obtained from the task page on the platform.

### Part 2. Building

#### Write a stage for **CI** to build applications from the *Bash_Utilities* project:

##### In the _gitlab-ci.yml_ file, add a stage to start the building via makefile from the _C2_ project

##### Save post-build files (artifacts) to a random directory with a 30-day retention period.


### Part 3. Codestyle test

#### Write a stage for **CI** that runs a codestyle script (*clang-format*):

##### If the codefile didn't pass, " fail" the pipeline

##### In the pipeline, display the output of the *clang-format* utility

### Part 4. Integration tests

#### Write a stage for **CI** that runs your integration tests from the same project:

##### Run this stage automatically only if the build and codestyle test passes successfully

##### If tests didn't pass, fail the pipeline

##### In the pipeline, display the output of the succeeded / failed integration tests

### Part 5. Deployment stage

##### Start the second virtual machine *Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS*

#### Write a stage for **CD** that "deploys" the project on another virtual machine:

##### Run this stage manually, if all the previous stages have passed successfully

##### Write a bash script which copies the files received after the building (artifacts) into the */usr/local/bin* directory of the second virtual machine using **ssh** and **scp**

*Here the knowledge gained from the DO2_LinuxNetwork project can help you*

- Be prepared to explain from the script how the relocation occurs.

##### In the _gitlab-ci.yml_ file, add a stage to run the script you have written

##### In case of an error, fail the pipeline

As a result, you should have applications from the *Bash_Utilities* (s21_cat and s21_grep) project ready to run on the second virtual machine.

##### Save dumps of virtual machine images
- Don't forget to run the pipeline with the last commit in the repository.

### Part 6. Notifications

##### Set up notifications of successful/unsuccessful pipeline execution via bot named "[your nickname] DO6 CI/CD" in *Telegram*
- The text of the notification must contain information on the successful passing of both **CI** and **CD** stages.
- The rest of the notification text may be arbitrary.
